Aim - To implement a K Means algorithm to classify hand written digits

# Dataset
Digits data from Sklearn

# K-Means Clustering
K Means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to divide our training data into k unique
clusters to classify information. This means this algorithm does not require labels for given test data.
It is responsible for learning the differences between our data points and determine what features determining what
class.

Supervised vs Unsupervised Algorithm
Up until this point we have been using supervised machine learning algorithms. Supervised learning means that when we
pass training data to our algorithm we also pass the estimated values or classes for each of those data points.
For example, when we were classifying the safety of cars we gave the algorithm the features of the car and we told it
if the car was safe or not. If we were using an unsupervised algorithm we would only pass the features and omit the
class.
