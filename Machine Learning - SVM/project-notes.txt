Aim - To use SVM to classify if a cancer cell is malignant or benign

# Dataset
Breast Cancer Data Set from Sklearn

# SVM
SVM stands for a support vector machine. SVM's are typically used for classification tasks similar to K Nearest
Neighbors. They work very well for high dimensional data and allow for us to classify data that does not have a
linear correspondence.

A SVM has a large list of applicable uses. However, in machine learning it is typically used for classification.
It is a powerful tool that is a good choice for classifying complicated data with a high degree of dimensions(features).
Note that K-Nearest Neighbors does not perform well on high-dimensional data.
