# MachineLearningExamples
4 Machine Learning models using Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and K-Means Clustering are outlined with example use cases.
These were completed with help from TechWithTim lessons on YouTube 

<b>Linear Regression</b>
Aim - To implement a linear regression algorithm to predict students final grade based on a series of attributes (integer attributes)
# Dataset
Student Performance dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
  
<b>SVM</b>
Aim - To use SVM to classify if a cancer cell is malignant or benign
# Dataset
Breast Cancer Data Set from Sklearn

<b>KNN</b>
Aim - To use K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify cars into 4 categories based upon certain features
# Dataset
Car Evaluation Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

<b>K-Means CLustering</b>
Aim - To implement a K Means algorithm to classify hand written digits
# Dataset
Digits data from Sklearn
  
# There are more detailed notes on how each model works in each of the respective folders
