# MachineLearningExamples
4 Machine Learning models using Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and K-Means Clustering are outlined with example use cases.
These were completed with help from TechWithTim lessons on YouTube 

# Linear Regression
<b>Aim</b> - To implement a linear regression algorithm to predict students final grade based on a series of attributes (integer attributes)

<b>Dataset</b>

Student Performance dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
  
# SVM
<b>Aim</b> - To use SVM to classify if a cancer cell is malignant or benign

<b>Dataset</b>

Breast Cancer Data Set from Sklearn

# KNN
<b>Aim</b> - To use K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify cars into 4 categories based upon certain features

<b>Dataset</b>

Car Evaluation Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

# K-Means CLustering
<b>Aim</b> - To implement a K Means algorithm to classify hand written digits

<b>Dataset</b>

Digits data from Sklearn
