# MachineLearningExamples
4 Machine Learning models using Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and K-Means Clustering are outlined with example use cases.
These were completed with help from TechWithTim lessons on YouTube 

# Linear Regression
Aim - To implement a linear regression algorithm to predict students final grade based on a series of attributes (integer attributes)
<b>Dataset</b>
Student Performance dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
  
# SVM
Aim - To use SVM to classify if a cancer cell is malignant or benign
<b>Dataset</b>
Breast Cancer Data Set from Sklearn

# KNN
Aim - To use K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify cars into 4 categories based upon certain features
<b>Dataset</b>
Car Evaluation Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

# K-Means CLustering
Aim - To implement a K Means algorithm to classify hand written digits
\n <b>Dataset</b>
Digits data from Sklearn
  
There are more detailed notes on how each model works in each of the respective folders
