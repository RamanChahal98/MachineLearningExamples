Aim - To use K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify cars into 4 categories based upon certain features

# Dataset
Car Evaluation Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

Car properties:
CAR car acceptability
. PRICE overall price
. . buying buying price
. . maint price of the maintenance
. TECH technical characteristics
. . COMFORT comfort
. . . doors number of doors
. . . persons capacity in terms of persons to carry
. . . lug_boot the size of luggage boot
. . safety estimated safety of the car

Class Values:
unacc, acc, good, vgood

Attributes:
buying: vhigh, high, med, low.
maint: vhigh, high, med, low.
doors: 2, 3, 4, 5more.
persons: 2, 4, more.
lug_boot: small, med, big.
safety: low, med, high.

# KNN
KNN stands for K-Nearest Neighbors. KNN is a machine learning algorithm used for classifying data. Rather than coming up
with a numerical prediction such as a students grade or stock price it attempts to classify data into certain categories.

The algorithm works best when we can identify clusters of points in the dataset.

Although the KNN algorithm is very good at performing simple classification tasks it has many limitations. One of which
is its Training/Prediction Time. Since the algorithm finds the distance between the data point and every point in the
training set it is very computationally heavy. Unlike algorithms like linear regression which simply apply a function to
a given data point the KNN algorithm requires the entire data set to make a prediction. This means every time we make a
prediction we must wait for the algorithm to compare our given data to each point. In data sets that contain millions of
elements this is a HUGE drawback.

Another drawback of the algorithm is its memory usage. Due to the way it works (outlined above) it requires that the
entire data set be loaded into memory to perform a prediction. It is possible to batch load our data into memory but
that is extremely time consuming.

Here we are trying to classify cars based on a few properties, to say whether they are unacc, acc, good, vgood
